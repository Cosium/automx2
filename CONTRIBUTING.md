# Contributing to automx2

Submitting ideas, suggestions and bug reports in the form of
[GitHub issues](https://github.com/rseichter/automx2) is welcome. Please refer to
[this blog article](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2016/03/03/start-with-an-issue/).

To avoid Copyright issues, I do not currently accept code contributions.
I hope that this will change at some future date. However, it is possible
to sponsor specific new features. Contact me via email to discuss this
in detail.
